This project started as a quick proof-of-concept of a real-time strategy for the open-souce 
Marketcetera trading platform.  The intention now is to mature the existing and introduce new 
examples.  Collaboration highly encouraged.  Contact author for contribution information.

SETUP:

Archives downloaded from GitHub will be packaged with an arbitrary root directory.  Extract the 
archive and simplify the root dir name.  Then, to run the example RealTimeMovingAverageSuggestions
strategy, find and edit RealTimeMovingAverageSuggestions.txt to reflect the true absolute path to 
the RealTimeMovingAverageSuggestions.java on your machine.  Built using Eclipse, the project files 
are included.
